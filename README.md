# Reusable Components Practice

A simple repo to store my reusable components practice and lessons


Theory:
 What What makes a component reusable? (props, slots/children, composition over inheritance)

 Differences between presentational and container components.
 Prop drilling vs context.

1. One Job Only â€“ Each block does one simple thing. For example, a Lego door only opens and closes. In React, a button component only looks and acts like a button.

2. Looks the Same Everywhere â€“ No matter where you put the Lego door, it still works as a door. Similarly, if you use your button component on different pages, it still looks and acts the same.

3. Customizable â€“ Just like you can put stickers on your Lego door ðŸšª or change its color, in React you can pass props to change the text or style of your button (e.g., "Save", "Cancel", "Delete").

4. Reusable â€“ Instead of making a new door from scratch every time, you reuse the same Lego door. Same with codeâ€”you donâ€™t rewrite the button every time, you just use your button component.

5. Shared Toolbox â€“ In a professional team, all these Lego blocks (components) are put into a shared toolbox (like a folder, library, or design system). This way, everyone on the team can grab the same block and use it, keeping everything consistent.

Example in React (our Lego block = a button):

```tsx
type ButtonProps = {
  label: string;
  onClick: () => void;
};

const Button = ({ label, onClick }: ButtonProps) => {
  return (
    <button
      onClick={onClick}
      className="px-4 py-2 rounded bg-blue-500 text-white hover:bg-blue-600"
    >
      {label}
    </button>
  );
};

// Reuse the button in different places:
<Button label="Save" onClick={handleSave} />
<Button label="Cancel" onClick={handleCancel} />
<Button label="Delete" onClick={handleDelete} />```

Exercise:
 Build a Button component:

 Variants (primary, secondary, danger)

 Sizes (sm, md, lg)

 Disabled state

Mini-Project:
 Build a Card component with slot-like children (header, body, footer).

 Use it with different content â†’ blog card, product card, profile card.
